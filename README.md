# Entanglement-based-QKD-with-Quantum-Computing-E91-protocol-
In this project, I intend to simulating entanglement based QKD (the E91 protocol) in quantum computers. I demonstrate that the secure key rate depends on the selected quantum hardware qubit-pair on which the experiment is executed, in the sense that the pair of qubit with lower two-qubit error provide lower QBER and higher key length.
